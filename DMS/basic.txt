Data:fact and figure that can be recorded in a system.
     (//information)
Database:Collection of related data stored at one place.
         (//collection of information).
The heart of information system is DMS.
Characteristics of DMS.:
1-Data intergrity(truthness,consistency).
2-Data Security.(secure)
3-Data Independence:Capacity to change data kept at one place without changing the data at another place.
4-Transaction control-rollback:The changes made can be reverted.
5-Concurrency control:the data in Database can be accessed by multiple user at same time.
6-Data recovery backup:restoring database to original state.

DMS Advantage:
-Multiple access.
-Computarized record keeping
-Easy retrival of data.
-Unauthorized user access is restricted.
-Redundancy can be controlled.(Duplicates data)//main point

Database architecture:-
Schema: plan
3 level architecture of Database
1-Internal/physical level:Physical Storage stucture.
1-Internal/physical Schema:Describes Data Types,specifies indexes.
2-Conceptual View:Hide internal data.
2-Conceptual Schema:Representation of entire content of Database.
3-External Level:Proper interface between user and database.
3-External Schema:Defination of various external data types.
